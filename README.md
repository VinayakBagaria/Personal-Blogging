# Personal-Blogging API using MongoDB,HTML,Flask and Python

The project uses Flask which is a framework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2. I use Jinja 2 for the HTML page.
It also uses MongoDB for database design.

1. src/common/database refers to the operations with mongodb. Don't forget to start the mongo db server before executing the python code.
2. src/models/blog is the file which describes a blog and saves it to our database.
3. src/models/post is the file which helps us to create a new post in a blog.
4. src/models/user registers/logins a user.

src/templates contain the HTML files with Jinja variables used in it. I have used Bootstrap to give some designing.
